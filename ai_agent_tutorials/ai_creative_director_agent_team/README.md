# üé¨ AI Creative Director Agent Team

## Overview

AI Creative Director is an AI Application that leverages OpenAI's Agents SDK with the new imag generation model image-gen-1 to streamline the creative process for advertising and marketing content. The system employs a sequential agent workflow where specialized AI agents collaborate to transform a simple concept into a complete ad package with professional scripts and visual inspiration.

## Features

### üñãÔ∏è Professional Script Writing

- Generates compelling ad scripts tailored to your specific requirements
- Adapts to different ad lengths (15 seconds, 30 seconds, etc.)
- Includes sound effects and music cues where appropriate
- Provides creative rationale explaining the strategic choices
- Analyzes target audience appeal and delivery recommendations

### üé® Visual Design Consultation

- Creates visual concepts that align with the script's message
- Offers constructive feedback to enhance visual impact
- Generates multiple image concepts using DALL-E 3
- Provides a complete style guide with color palette and typography recommendations

### ü§ñ Advanced Agent Architecture

- Sequential agent workflow (Writing ‚Üí Design)
- Each agent specializes in their domain for optimal results
- Seamless handoff between agents preserves context
- Fallback mechanisms ensure reliable image generation

### üíª Modern User Interface

- Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface
- Tabbed results for easy navigation
- API key management via sidebar
- Optional fields for target audience and brand information
- Image download functionality

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4o and GPT-Image-1
- OpenAI Agents Python SDK

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git
cd awesome-llm-apps/ai_agent_tutorials/ai_creative_director_agent_team
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Get your OpenAI API Key

- Sign up for an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/) and obtain your API key
- The app uses both GPT-4 for script generation and DALL-E 3 for image generation

4. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run ai_creative_director_agent.py
```

### How it Works?

The AI Creative Director Agent Team has two main components:

- Writing Agent: Responsible for generating creative ad scripts based on the user's brand information, target audience, and requirements
- Design Agent: Takes the generated script and creates matching visuals using DALL-E 3, ensuring brand consistency and visual appeal

The agents work sequentially to provide a complete creative solution for your advertising needs.
This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Creating an Ad Concept

1. Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar (if not set as an environment variable)
2. Fill in the "Describe the ad you want to create" field with your concept
   - Example: "Help me make a 15 sec ad for my makeup brand"
3. (Optional) Provide target audience information
   - Example: "Women 25-34 interested in beauty and self-care"
4. (Optional) Add brand information
   - Example: "ColorBurst is a new makeup brand focused on natural ingredients and vibrant colors"
5. Click "‚ú® Create Ad Concept"
6. Review the results in the tabs:
   - üìú Script: The complete ad script with creative rationale
   - üé® Visual Concept: Design feedback and style guide
   - üñºÔ∏è Generated Images: Visual concepts for your ad

## Architecture

The application uses a sequential agent architecture:

1. **Writing Agent**: Creates the ad script based on user input

   - Analyzes the request, target audience, and brand information
   - Generates a complete script with creative rationale
   - Provides delivery notes and audience appeal analysis
2. **Design Agent**: Takes the script and creates visual concepts

   - Analyzes the script's tone, style, and key messages
   - Suggests visual enhancements to the script
   - Generates images using gpt-image-1
   - Creates a comprehensive style guide

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Agent Instructions

You can modify the agent instructions in `image.py` to adapt their behavior:

- `writing_agent.instructions`: Customize how the writing agent creates scripts
- `design_agent.instructions`: Adjust how the design agent generates visual concepts

### Adding New Agents

The system is designed to be extensible. You can add new agents to the workflow by:

1. Creating a new agent definition with appropriate instructions
2. Adding any necessary tool functions
3. Updating the `run_sequential_agents` function to include the new agent

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API Key Errors**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has access to GPT-4o and gpt-image-1
- **Image Generation Failures**: The system includes fallback mechanisms to generate images directly if needed
- **Memory Issues**: For complex requests, try breaking them into smaller components
